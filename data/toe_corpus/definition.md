The Theory of Entropicity (ToE) is a foundational scientific framework that positions entropy as the primary substrate of reality. It describes how entropic fields give rise to physical structure, dynamics, and information flow. The theory provides core axioms, the Master Entropic Equation, and the Obidi Field Equations, forming a unified conceptual and mathematical architecture for understanding the emergence of order from entropy.
